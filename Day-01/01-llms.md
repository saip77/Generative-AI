# Understanding LLMs

## What is a Language Model?

- It is a program that uses Neural Networks to predict next set of words in a sentence.
- It operates purely on statistical probability and randomness based on past conversations and data it has been trained on. It does not understand the meaning of the words the way a human does.
- Example :- G-Mail autocomplete

## What is a LLM?

- It is a language model with immense scale
- It is trained on massive volume of data.
- LLM contains neural networks with billions of parameters, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in language.
- Example :- GPT-3, GPT-4 etc.
